# Logic-Circuit-Simulator
Simple logic circuit design simulator based on OOP in C++. Different gates, LEDs, keys, and wires are used to design your circuit. Just draw Your circuit and run to see the output :)


This project aims mainly to cover topics of OOP such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism,...
Components of design:
Gates:
  ❑ Buffer gate and inverter gate
  ❑ 2-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR gates
  ❑ 3-input AND, NOR, XOR
 Led
 Switch
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Modes of operation: Design mode - Simulation mode
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Design mode Features:
1. Delete components
2. label components
3. copy/cut components
4. save the current circuit in a .txt file
5. load previously saved circuits from the .txt
6. Edit connection between components

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simulation mode:
Run the circuit designed above to see the output on the LEDs.
